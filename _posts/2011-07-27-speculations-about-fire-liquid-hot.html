Rather, it is a playful exercise in speculation and even 'just so stories' about human evolution and fire.</i></blockquote>And the author Michael Medler certainly does speculate.&nbsp; He starts by making the observation that hominins&nbsp; (east African ones at least) evolved in a region characterized by very active volcanism (indisputable). Perhaps then, he goes on, fire has shaped human adaptations over millions of years.&nbsp; This is not totally outside the realm of what some actual anthropologists have said (e.g <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Catching-Fire-Cooking-Made-Human/dp/0465013627">Wrangham, 2009</a>)....more or less that fire for cooking food and warmth was really important late in human evolution as hominins spread out of the tropics.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

 </tbody></table><br /><br />But Medler goes wild, arguing that fire can explain human hairlessness (hair burns!), tool use (hand-axes are fuel processing tools), and even the origins of bipedalism.&nbsp;&nbsp; He actually goes so far in his Figure 2&nbsp; to talk about how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardipithecus">Ardi</a>'s purported combination of arboreal behaviors and bipedalism would have been very good for collecting firewood and walking over to feed already burning volcanic fires on the ground! <i><b>Could be</b></i>, but I doubt it.&nbsp; This is kind of like the (fiery)savannah hypothesis redux, and has all the the problems that the savannah hypothesis has for the earlier part of human evolution. Also, it is totally untestable...how would we ever know whether or not Ardi was feeding sticks to natural fires and having her hair burn off? Crazy stuff, but kind of fun to think about.</div>
