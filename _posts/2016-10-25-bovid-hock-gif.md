This was the first GIF I ever made.  

![GIF showing rotation at the bovid ankle](http://i.imgur.com/4TK0euC.gif)

When I was working on my dissertation on bovid ecomorphology, I was having trouble visualizing the way in which rotation occured, first at the trasverse tarsal joint, and then at the upper ankle joint.  So I pulled out my trusty [*Ammotragus lervia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_sheep) leg skeleton and started snapping photos. Then I cobbled it together into an animated GIF and *voila*, I had a much clearer picture of what was going on!  I wish I have been a bit more consisten with the lighting though.......
