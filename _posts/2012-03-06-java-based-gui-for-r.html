<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><a href="http://rforge.net/JGR/">JGR</a> is a pretty nice Java based GUI for R.&nbsp; The primary reason I like this is that it is truly cross platform, and will work the same for any operating system<br /><br />Added benefits are that some packages like rJava and others tend to break on Mac OSX, but work fine when run through JGR. </div>
