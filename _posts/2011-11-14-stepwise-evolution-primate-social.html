This "reversible--jump model" seems pretty non-intuitive, but is the best model for their data set. It will be interesting to see how this is received by primatologists.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"> Their results also support a "step-wise" acquisition of stable social groupings which starts out with loose aggregations of individuals banding together for predation defense in association with becoming diurnal. More stable social associations are a secondary occurrence that only come about later in time. </div>
