Results are published in a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.21580">brief communication in AJPA</a>.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The results are very preliminary, but her sleep was less disturbed in nests, she suffered fewer insect bites, and the nests appeared to provide some insulation from the cold.&nbsp; Perhaps the most telling result was in terms of sleep quality:</div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">"All experimental nightsâ€™ sleep in this study were uncomfortable and characterized by low sleep quality (&lt;0.50), compared with mean sleep quality recorded for captive chimpanzees (0.86) and human societies (Videan, 2006).
