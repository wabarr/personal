This new study confirms that, but indicates that in a significant portion of the gorilla genome, gorillas are more similar to humans than to chimps.&nbsp; This makes an often misunderstood point: that different genes can have different evolutionary histories, and that the family tree for a given gene often looks different from the family tree for a species.&nbsp; The study authors offer consensus dates for the divergence of the chimp and gorilla lineages from humans at approximately 6 and 10 million years ago.&nbsp; </div></div>
