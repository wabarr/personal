These fossils are important because they are so complete, and because their discoverers have suggested that the new species may be directly ancestral to our own genus <i>Homo</i>.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1202703">The paper by Zipfel et al </a>describes the foot and ankle bones, including an articulated distal tibia, talus and calcaneus preserved encased in matrix in approximately anatomical position. Other foot specimens include a very complete distal tibia as well some metatarsals. The details of the ankle joint are pretty human-like except for a very robust medial malleolus. The real kicker is the calcaneus, which is quite gracile and lacks a weight bearing lateral plantar process (LPP). These features make the calcaneus look rather like a chimpanzee's. Coupled with the robust medial malleolus, this could mean that <i>A. sediba</i> retained a degree of arboreal climbing competence.  I feel sure that the functional implications of this morphology will be heartily debated.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">What is especially interesting is that <i>A. afarensis </i>resembles modern humans in these details of the calcaneus and distal tibia.<i> A. afarensis </i>(the species <a href="http://www.elucy.org/">Lucy</a> belongs to)<i> </i>is the gracile australopithecine cousin of <i>A. sediba</i> which lived over a million years earlier and is widely considered the direct ancestor of genus <i>Homo</i>. Regardless of whether or not <i>A. sediba</i> is directly ancestral to <i>Homo</i> or not, this mosaic ankle morphology is interesting and suggests some level of independent evolution of modern human-like pedal morphology.</div><br /><br />
