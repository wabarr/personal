<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">The team from the site of Dmanisi in Georgia <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6156/326.abstract">just published the description of their "Skull 5"</a>, which represents the fifth well preserved skull from this important 1.8 million year old site from the Republic of Georgia.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nUf-6Eu_bvU/UmFDnNEuJVI/AAAAAAAANe8/z6Ru0Ez0E-M/s1600/628x471.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nUf-6Eu_bvU/UmFDnNEuJVI/AAAAAAAANe8/z6Ru0Ez0E-M/s320/628x471.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Skull 5: credit&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; text-align: left;">&nbsp;Georgia National Museum, AP</span></span></td></tr></tbody></table>This skull is super important, because it is quite different from the other four Dmanisi skulls in that is has a massive face and jaw, and just a tiny brain at about 550cc. Thus, the authors argue that the Dmanisi sample from a single place and a relatively short time interval encompasses virtually all of the variation found in early <i>Homo</i> specimens from Africa. This would imply that the proposed species diversity in early <i>Homo</i> is not really species diversity at all, unless you want to split the Dmanisi specimen into multiple species.<br /><br />The specimen is getting TONS of well-deserved press attention, but much of the coverage is predictably sensationalist....claiming that this skull overturns what we thought we knew about the human family tree. &nbsp;A more accurate description might be that this skull offers fresh evidence which is lending new support to a long-standing idea in paleoanthropology (i.e. that early <i>Homo</i> is characterized best as one species).</div>
