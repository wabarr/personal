One long-standing question concerns the diet of robust australopithicines, a group of three species of early hominin that most researchers place together in the genus <i>Paranthropus</i>. These three species share a suite of adaptations of the teeth, jaws and cranium which all relate to extremely powerful chewing. The consensus among researchers has been that <i>Paranthropus</i> species ate a diet of hard objects (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OH_5">nuts</a> or hard fruits), or perhaps a difficult-to-process diet of tubers and other undergrouund plant storage organs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">A new carbon isotope study reported in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1104627108%20">this article in PNAS</a> by Cerling and colleagues argues that <i>P. boisei</i> subsisted on C4 vegetation like grass and sedges, not on hard objects (hence the cow photo). This is consistent a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002044">previous study of dental microwear</a> by Ungar et al. of which found no evidence for hard object feeding in <i>P. boisei</i>.&nbsp; This result is surprising, as several dental microwear studies of the southern African robust hominin <i>P. robustus</i> are consistent with hard object feeding in this species, and carbon isotopes for <i>robustus </i>show much more C3 plant use (C3 vegetation comes from bushes and trees, including fruit). Thus, it appears that there may have been considerable dietary diversity within this genus, with <i>P. boisei</i> having diverged from a more "traditional" primate diet to focus on grazing.&nbsp; </div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div></div>
