We were discussing the great paper by&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.20532">Elizabeth Kelley and Robert Sussman</a>&nbsp;in which they trace the academic genealogy of field primatologists. We were lamenting the fact that there wasn't a comparable tree for other sub-specializations within physical anthropology.&nbsp;We decided that tracing academic history is important, and that creating an online version driven by user submissions was the best way to build out the tree.<br /><br />Please check out the site. &nbsp;If you are a physical anthropology PhD (or know somebody who is), make sure their name appears. If it doesn't appear, <a href="http://bit.ly/PhysAnthSubmit">be sure to add it</a>!</div>
