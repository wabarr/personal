title: Ancienteco - Rebooted

I just launched the rebooted version of my blog.  This is something I have long been meaning to do.  In my old setup, I had the blog running on google's blogger platform, and I was managing my personal website using the [Django web-application](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework.  This resulted in an unnecessarily complicated setup that I just wasn't happy with.  

The new site you are reading right now is hosted for free by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is built using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  This means I can manage my blog and the personal site in exactly the same way, which I like.  It also means that everything is version controlled using Github, which I also like.  Overall, I am very happy with the new system! 

**Welcome to my new site!**
