They report the results of a dissection based study of 100 mammalian species.&nbsp; They did not find a negative correlation between brain size and gut mass, <a href="http://www.ancienteco.com/2011/08/no-support-for-expensive-tissue.html">as would be predicted by the Expensive Tissue Hypothesis</a>.&nbsp; Instead, they DID find a negative correlation between brain size and the mass of adipose (fat) deposits.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The authors interpret these results as supporting an alternative view of the energetics of encephalization.&nbsp; They argue that increasing body fat is one strategy to protect against starvation. A different strategy involves developing a larger brain, which comes along with intelligence and the behavioral flexibility needed to secure a steady food supply.&nbsp; However, fat tissue is metabolically cheap, so what explains the negative relationship between brain size and fat?&nbsp; They argue that fat is expensive energetically because you have to literally carry it around!&nbsp; Thus, there is an energetic cost in transporting your fat reserves wherever you go.&nbsp; </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The final major point is in explaining humans, which are both particularly fatty AND particularly brainy.&nbsp; The authors argue that hominins are able to have the best of both worlds thanks to their unique (and energetically effecient) form of locomotion....striding bipedalism.&nbsp; Bipedalism, in the end, allows us to efficiently transport our fatty selves from one patch of food to the next, and to think deep thoughts while doing so.&nbsp; </div>
