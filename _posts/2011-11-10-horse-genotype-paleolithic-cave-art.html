In a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1108982108">report in PNAS</a>, Pruvost and colleagues describe the results of DNA analysis of 31 wild, pre-domestic horses from Europe.&nbsp; Their findings indicate that the full range of horse coloration depicted in French cave art were present in pre-domestic horses, based on the distribution of genes linked to coat color expression.&nbsp; This study suggests that prehistoric cave painters weren't making up animals...these coat coloration actually existed in horses in the wild.&nbsp; </div><br /><br />
