By the very same logic we should rename the Tibetan blackbird (<a href="http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/tibetan-blackbird-turdus-maximus"><i>Turdus maximus</i></a>) simply because its turds are nowhere near as large as some other vertebrate species.<br /><br />Thanks to <a href="http://www.gabriellerusso.com/">Gabrielle Russo</a> for pointing this letter out to me.&nbsp; </div>
