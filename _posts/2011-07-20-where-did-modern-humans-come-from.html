In a <a href="http://www.ancienteco.com/2011/07/modern-human-source-populatoin-in-north.html">previous post</a> I discussed an argument that the source population might have been of North African origin.&nbsp; The paper arguing for a North African origin was actually a response to <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1017511108%20">this paper by Henn and colleages</a>, who conducted a genetic analysis of living hunter gatherers.&nbsp; Their results indicate that Southern African hunter gatherer populations have greater genetic  diversity than hunter-gatherers in other parts of Africa, thus these  populations are inferred to be older. I am slightly uncomfortable with this conclusion, because I don't understand how the authors can rule out the existence of more ancient modern human populations in other parts of Africa which have not survived to the present day.&nbsp; But, on second thought, wouldn't that same argument apply to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve">any argument based on modern human genetic diversity</a>?<br /><br />Both the North African and Southern African arguments are in conflict with the most commonly accepted notion that modern humans evolved in East Africa.&nbsp; An East African origin is supported by the fact that Ethiopia is home to the oldest fossil evidence of modern humans from Omo Kibish (McDougall et al., 2005,<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050214/full/news050214-10.html"> news story</a>), as well as the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature01669">slightly younger fossils from Herto in the Middle Awash</a>.
