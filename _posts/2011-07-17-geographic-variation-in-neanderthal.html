Zaatari et al. report (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2011.05.004">in an early view article in the Journal of Human Evolution</a>) on the diets of a large sample of Neanderthals from across their geographic range, inferred using molar microwear texture analysis.&nbsp; Results support previous studies indicating Neanderthals ate lots of meat...but the analysis revealed significant variability in the amount of plant foods incorporated in the diet.&nbsp; I find this interesting for several reasons, including the current "Paleo Diet" craze I have been hearing about lately.&nbsp; Even Neanderthals, a temporally and geographically restricted group, had significant variability in their diet....imagine the amount of variability in the much more ecologically diverse groups of modern human foragers the paleo-diet folks are trying to mimic. Which paleodiets should I try to follow?&nbsp; The highly carnivorous ones? or the mostly vegetarian ones?<br /><a name='more'></a><br />El Zaatari S, Grine FE, Ungar PS, and Hublin J-J.
