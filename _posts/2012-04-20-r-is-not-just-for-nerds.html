<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FCxVbiZn3-I/T5HONgihaoI/AAAAAAAAI7o/8uaMlVX5PJc/s1600/JGR.tiff" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FCxVbiZn3-I/T5HONgihaoI/AAAAAAAAI7o/8uaMlVX5PJc/s1600/JGR.tiff" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">JGR Logo</td></tr></tbody></table><br />This post introduces how to use the Java Gui for R (JGR, pronounced Jaguar) along with the Deducer package (<a href="http://www.deducer.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.DeducerManual">manual here</a>) to get a fairly full featured graphical user interface for R.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Installation</b></span><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br /><b>Note</b>: Be sure you are logged into an account with administrative privileges, or some stuff won't won't install correctly but will give only cryptic error messages. <br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Make sure you have <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">the most recent version of R</a> (currently 2.15.0) installed.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="http://rforge.net/JGR/files/">Install JGR</a>. On Windows, download and run the jgr-1_62.exe file or the jgr-1_62-x64.exe file for 64-bit systems. On Mac OSX, download and run JGR-1.6-SL.dmg.&nbsp; If you are a Linux/Unix user you can figure this out yourself.</li><li>Open JGR and make sure you don't get any error messages. If you do I can only suggest the google. Make sure you are an administrator!</li><li>Now, you can install the Deducer package from within JGR using the package manager.&nbsp; Find the menu item Packages &amp; Data &gt; Package Installer.&nbsp; If you are prompted to pick a "CRAN Mirror" select one that is geographically close to you. When a long list of packages appears,&nbsp; choose "Deducer", and click Install. A lot of text will whiz by as R installs this package from the interwebs (a series of tubes).</li><li>Once it quits downloading, you need to load the package into active memory. Close the package installer, and from the same Packages &amp; Data menu, choose the Package Manager. You will see a list of available packages.&nbsp; Check the box next to "Loaded" to load the Deducer package.</li></ul><br />The Data Viewer should pop-up with options for you. You are ready to graphically use this interface to R!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O1DC17crzeg/T5HIfx2VN9I/AAAAAAAAI7Y/-wOB9mlMH9k/s1600/DataViewerLoadData.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O1DC17crzeg/T5HIfx2VN9I/AAAAAAAAI7Y/-wOB9mlMH9k/s320/DataViewerLoadData.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Notice that in addition to opening this new window, loading the Deducer package changed the available menu items for JGR.&nbsp; Now you have things like "Analysis" and "Plots" as options.<br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: large;">Loading Data</span></b><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: small;">Click on "Open Data" to import your data.&nbsp; JGR/Deducer can open many types of files.&nbsp; For best results, I would try using a comma or tab delimited text file. Also, double check that each column of data only has one type of data (e.g. a number versus text).&nbsp; Once you get your data loaded, the pop-up window turns into something like a spreadsheet that shows you your data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Plotting</b></span><br /><br />On the menu, click "Plots &gt; Plots Builder".&nbsp; This feature alone will be worth the price of admission for a lot of people.&nbsp; If I continue to find this useful, there will be a future post on how this works.&nbsp; For now....experiment!<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Analysis </b></span><br /><br />So now you are ready for some analysis. Ummm...just look at all those new menu  items and do whatever analysis you want. The interface is pretty  similar to what I have seen of pre-packaged stats programs (like SPSS),  but I am not at all fluent in the Menu driven options in either JGR/Deducer or any of those other programs. For much of what you will want to do though, you will do linear models.<br /><br /><b>Linear Models - The Workhorse of R</b><br /><br />What do multiple regression, ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA and Plain-Old Least Squares Regression have in common? They are all linear models.&nbsp; This simplifies your life because in R, you only have to use this one tool to do a lot of different analyses.&nbsp; Simply find the menu item "Analysis &gt; Linear Model".&nbsp; This will launch the below window. <b></b><br /><b><br /></b><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bIwvTQAjIy4/T5HMZCiQ6QI/AAAAAAAAI7g/6lYxsFtGV0c/s1600/linearModels.tiff" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bIwvTQAjIy4/T5HMZCiQ6QI/AAAAAAAAI7g/6lYxsFtGV0c/s400/linearModels.tiff" width="347" /></a></div><b><br /></b><br />&nbsp;Choose your outcome variable, as well as any numeric or categorical (factor) variables.&nbsp; R automatically knows which type of analysis to do based on the input variables.&nbsp; Assuming your outcome is always continous: put in a single Factor, it will do an ANOVA. Put in two numeric variables, it does multiple regression. Etc. </div><br /><br /></div>
