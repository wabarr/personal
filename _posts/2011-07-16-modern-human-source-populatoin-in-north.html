<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1105710108%20">This article in early view on the PNAS website</a> by J-J Hublin and Richard Klein argues that North African human cultures making Aterian Middle Stone Age tool industry might have been the source population for modern humans.<br /><br />This area is near-and-dear to me because I was on a dig there in the summer of 2009, the year the team discovered a modern human skull.&nbsp; This skull, nicknamed Bouchra, was recently featured in a <a href="http://natgeotv.com.au/tv/worlds-oldest-child/">special on the National Geographic Channel. &nbsp; </a>
