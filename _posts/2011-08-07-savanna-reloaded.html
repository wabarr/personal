They compare the modern results to a very large sample of fossil soil (paleosol) samples from the Awash valley and the Omo Turkana basins.&nbsp; These two valleys in Ethiopia collectively sample approximately the last 6.5 million years of human evolution.&nbsp; Their results indicate that open environments (not forests) have dominated these two valleys over much of the course of the last 6.5 million years.&nbsp; This study is also part of the ongoing debate over the paleoenvironment of Aramis, the site from which <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/10/091001-oldest-human-skeleton-ardi-missing-link-chimps-ardipithecus-ramidus.html"><i>Ardipithicus ramidus</i></a> is best known. &nbsp; Tim White and the Ardi crew argue that the Aramis site was heavily wooded and, further, that Ardi puts the coffin nail in the savanna hypothesis. Cerling et al. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1185274">replied</a>, arguing that the Aramis isotope evidence indicated more open environs than White and colleagues claimed.&nbsp; This most recent paper provides evidence consistent with the interpretation that the Aramis site was pretty open, even more open than later <i>A. afarensis</i> sites.&nbsp; </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><a name='more'></a><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

 </tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">The most interesting part of this study for me is their "paleo-shade proxy", which is essentially a continuous variable based on the relationship that they demonstrate between soil δ<sup>13</sup>C values and the percentage of the ground that is covered by woody cover. This sounds really promising as a way to quantify aspects of habitat openness versus closedness, moving beyond&nbsp; the frustrating and rather vague habitat classification schemes (open woodland, shrubland, grassland etc.) used in many other studies.</div>
