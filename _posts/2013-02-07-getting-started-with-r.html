<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="text-align: justify;">As a PhD student and researcher, I often hear friends and colleagues say that they want to learn R, but that the learning curve is so steep that they can't seem to get started. &nbsp;It's true that learning any tool as powerful as R can be confusing at first, especially if you are not&nbsp;accustomed&nbsp;to typing commands in a terminal. &nbsp;That said, there are TONS of resources available for learning R. &nbsp;This post describes some of the resources that I have found most useful in my jouRney.</span><br /><div><b><br /></b><b>Online Resources</b></div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="http://tryr.codeschool.com/">O'Reilly Code School TryR</a>&nbsp;- this is a truly fantastic online interactive introduction to learning basic skills in R. &nbsp;Warning: the tutorial has a persistent pirate metaphor.</li><li><a href="http://www.twotorials.com/">twotorials</a>&nbsp;- 2 minute videos that teach you how to do simple tasks in R.&nbsp;"got two minutes? Learn some statistical programming in R. &nbsp;Its easy, free, and FUN!"</li><li><a href="http://www.statmethods.net/index.html">Quick-R</a>&nbsp;is a fast way to learn what you need to get started. &nbsp;I found this site after I had learned the basics, but it really seems great.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for reminding me about this resource, <a href="http://www.ancienteco.com/2013/02/getting-started-with-r.html?showComment=1360285741582#c2642735654428008287">&nbsp;a Tom</a>.</li><li><a href="http://flowingdata.com/category/tutorials/">flowingdata tutorials</a>&nbsp;- these are focussed tutorials on specific topics, like dealing with charts in R</li><li><a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-bloggers</a>&nbsp;is a aggregator that brings together hundreds of blogs on R, including this one. I highly recommend subscribing to their RSS feed to keep up with the latest.&nbsp;</li><li>google.com - it seems obvious.....but google is your best friend. &nbsp;Getting&nbsp;a weird error message? Try copying and pasting it into google. &nbsp;Chances aRe that hundreds of other people have had the same error and you might find some help. &nbsp;</li><li>Can't figure out your problem on the google? &nbsp;Reach out to the R user community. <b>Caveat:&nbsp;</b>Power R users, especially the developers, are among smartest people I have ever been in contact with. &nbsp;They are active in the community and they can answer your questions! &nbsp;And they will, within minutes or hours, but only if you ask the question in the correct way. &nbsp;For instance, if you say "omg....why am I getting this error"....you may only hear crickets. &nbsp;If you instead distill the problem down to its simplest form, ideally with a self-contained example, you are very likely to have your problem solved. &nbsp;It takes some effort to formulate your question clearly, and often you figure out what went wrong in the process.&nbsp;</li><ul><li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>&nbsp;- there is an extremely active R user base on Stack Overflow. &nbsp;Questions get answered very quickly...and users can vote on the best answer, so you can avoid wading through unhelpful answers (in the event there are any).&nbsp;</li><li>You can also try emailing the <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help">R help mailing list</a>. This is another very active community which includes many of the core developers of R. &nbsp;For best results -- especially on this mailing list -- try not to submit poorly&nbsp;formulated&nbsp;questions.
