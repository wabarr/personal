I am a paleoecologist and paleoanthropologist interested in understanding the environmental context of early human evolution. My research examines the ecological factors that shaped the evolution of our early ancestors. I conduct fieldwork in the Afar region of Ethiopia with the <a href="/fieldwork/">Mille-Logya Research Project</a>.

<p>Currently, I am a PostDoctoral Scientist in the <a href="http://cashp.columbian.gwu.edu/">Center for the Advanced Study of Human Paleobiology</a> and the <a href="http://anthropology.columbian.gwu.edu/">Department of Anthropology</a> at The George Washington University in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>
My dissertation focused on reconstructing past environments of the Shungura Formation in southwestern Ethiopia using bovid ecomorphology. My work expanded the method of ecomorphology to explicitly consider phylogeny and body size.
