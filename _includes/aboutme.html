I am a paleoanthropologist interested in understanding the environmental context of early human evolution. My research examines the paleoecological forces that shaped the evolution of our early ancestors. As such, this research is inherently interdiciplinary, bringing together anthropology, paleontology, and ecology. I conduct fieldwork in the Afar region of Ethiopia with the <a href="/fieldwork/">Mille-Logya Research Project</a>.

<p>Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Scientist in the <a href="http://cashp.columbian.gwu.edu/">Center for the Advanced Study of Human Paleobiology</a> and the <a href="http://anthropology.columbian.gwu.edu/">Department of Anthropology</a> at The George Washington University in Washington, D.C.</p>

I study the morphological adaptations of African fauna (antelope in particular) in order to reconstruct past human environments. This ecomorphological research relies heavily on 3D imaging and 3D data analysis. I have recently applied these methods to reconstruct past hominin habitats at Omo Shungura in southwestern Ethiopia. Currently, my focus is on understanding the environmental context of the earliest members of our genus <em>Homo</em>.
